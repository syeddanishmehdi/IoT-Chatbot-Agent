# 🤖 AI-Powered Cumulocity IoT Chatbot

This project is a lightweight, Python-based chatbot that connects with the **Cumulocity IoT** platform and **Groq's Mixtral LLM** to answer natural language queries. It demonstrates how open APIs and large language models (LLMs) can be combined to build an intelligent interface for querying IoT data.
